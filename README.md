## Specialized dictionaries

In this section, we are going to look at other specialized types of dictionaries that the python standard library provides

1. defaultdict :- Automatic default values for "missing" keys.

2. OrderedDict :- Gauranteed key ordering (based on insertion order), plus some extras.

3. Counter :- Specialized tools for dealing with counters.

4. ChainMap :- Efficient way of "combining" multiple dictionaries.

5. UserDict :- Alternative to subclassing dict for creating custom dictionary types.
